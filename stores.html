					Four score and 7 years ago our forefather and Puritan Cape Cod founder, Abe Penn, brought forth a pair of khaki pants to the Coast Guard Station in Chatham. They were rugged, seaworthy and as American as they get. In fact, these are the pants that went on to become the classic staple of the American wardrobe.

					Well after 87 years, these pants are back. The new Chatham Chino by Puritan Cape Cod. 100% cotton twill pants inspired by the very same military Coast Guard issue in 1925.  And updated as only Puritan can. Theyâ€™re washed, weathered and extremely comfortable for that authentic look and feel. A true American original like no other.
